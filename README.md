Dear friends,

Happy new year!

As many of you will know, I have a bit of a tradition going on at the end of a year - or at the beginning of the next. In one way or another I always try to review the year and prepare for the coming one, usually in written form. I think it’s healthy, an exercise that helps me recap and think about my life while also letting me gear up and get ready for what is coming. I recommend it dearly.

After several iterations I’ve come to realise the best form for this exercise is writing a letter to my future self. The letter format lets me be conversational and honest while also keeping it very readable when I come back to it at the end of the next year. A conversation through time that gives me a look into the past and an insight into what I expected the year to be.

I’ve built a website to help me with this exercise and I’d like to share it with you; maybe you’d like to use it for yourself. yearlify.com is a very simple site: it explains how it all works, guides you through signing up and then let’s you write a letter to yourself. On the following 30th of December, it sends you an email with that letter so you can review it. That simple. 

Yearlify is obviously a free service, and so far it’s very much a work in progress, but I’d be very happy for you to use it if you think you’d like it. The text you write is ran through an encryption algorithm, stored as a jumble of text that I (or no one, for that fact) can read until it gets decrypted and sent to you the following 26th of December - I built it with privacy as a top priority given what we’re dealing with.

If you do use it, I’ll be thankful if you can give me feedback so I can improve it, as you’ll see its very much in an early stage and there’s a lot to do yet. Let me know how it goes.

Wishing you the very best on 2021.

Hugs,

Enrique Tasa.
